Dom0 setup:
To switch around credit and rtds:
$ nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg
comment/uncomment the line with rtds/credit and then reboot. ( make sure domUs are all shutdown when reboot)

Start up:
1. $ service xencommons start
2. $ cd /root/images

to run credit:
$ ./xen2_full_vm.sh 1 2
to run rtds:
$ ./rtxen2_full.sh 1 2


to find ip address of VMs:

$ arp -an


in both VMs

$ screen

(press crtl + A , hold the crtl, then press D to swtich back)
(exit to close the screen session)

For xen-credit:

$ cd /root/liblitmus/mytools
$ nano /root/liblitmus/mytools/myapp.c change loopcount to 480
$ make

For xen-rtds:

$ cd /root/liblitmus/mytools
$ nano /root/liblitmus/mytools/myapp.c change loopcount to 450
$ make


ssh into VM2:

$ cd /root/hypervisor_experiments

$ git pull

cd hypervisor_experiments/sched_experiments

base on what you want to run, change util, periods , duration ,iteration in rerun.sh, run_ratio.sh, run_bench_Array_granular.sh

$ ./rerun.sh

exit VM2


ssh into VM1:

$ cd /root/hypervisor_experiments

$ git pull

cd hypervisor_experiments/sched_experiments

base on what you want to run, change util, periods , iteration in rerun.sh, run_ratio.sh, run_bench_Array_granular.sh

to run the experiments:

$ ./rerun.sh

when the experiemtn is done,

$ mv run-data/myapp/*ratio ./{folder_you_create}

To plot in MATLAB,

put {foler_you_create} into the same directory as plot_experiments.m and then change plot_experiments.m accordingly

run plot_experiments.m
