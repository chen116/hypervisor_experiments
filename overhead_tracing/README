Dom0 setup:
To switch around credit and rtds:
$ nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg
comment/uncomment the line with rtds/credit and then reboot. ( make sure domUs are all shutdown when reboot)

need to replace /root/xen-4.5.0/xen/common/schedule.c with /root/hypervisor_experiments/schedule.c and then rebuild xen (http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Compiling_Xen_From_Source) 

$ cd /root/xen-4.5.0
$ nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg    (change either rtds/credit from dom0_max_vcpus=1 to dom0_max_vcpus=16 vcpu for faster build)
$ reboot
$ make dist -j116 && make world -j16 && make install -j16
$ reboot




Start up:
1. $ service xencommons start
2. $ cd /root/images

to run credit:
$ ./xen2_full_vm.sh 1 2
to run rtds:
$ ./rtxen2_full.sh 1 2

to find ip address of VMs:

$ arp -an


in both VMs

$ screen

(press crtl + A , hold the crtl, then press D to swtich back)
(exit to close the screen session)

For xen-credit:

$ cd /root/liblitmus/mytools
$ nano /root/liblitmus/mytools/myapp.c change loopcount to 480
$ make

For xen-rtds:

$ cd /root/liblitmus/mytools
$ nano /root/liblitmus/mytools/myapp.c change loopcount to 450
$ make



ssh into VM2:

$ cd /root/hypervisor_experiments

$ git pull

$ cd /root/hypervisor_experiments/overhead_tracing

base on what you want to run, change util, periods , duration ,iteration in rerun.sh, run_ratio.sh, run_bench_Array_granular.sh

$ ./rerun.sh

exit VM2


ssh into VM1:

(create a screen with name test)
$ screen -S test

in Dom0:

$ cd /root/hypervisor_experiments

$ git pull



1. make sure you can ssh without password between Dom0 and VM1 ( I have set it up) (http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html)
2. change the ip addr in overhead_tracing/hyper_ovm.sh to VM1's ip
3. ssh into VM2 and change the duration (secs) in sched_experiments/rerun.sh to a larger number
4. from Dom0, $ bash hyper_ovm.sh


To plot:

$ python organize.py {ovm_files_folder}

take the output from the console for events count and time and put into the graph_ovm.m to graph.
