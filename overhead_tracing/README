Dom0 setup:
To switch around credit and rtds:
$ nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg
comment/uncomment the line with rtds/credit and then reboot. ( make sure domUs are all shutdown when reboot)

need to replace schedule.c with schedule.c and then rebuild xen (http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Compiling_Xen_From_Source) 

Start up:
1. $ service xencommons start
2. $ cd /root/images

to run credit:
$ ./xen2_full_vm.sh
to run rtds:
$ ./rtxen2_full.sh

to find ip address of VMs:

$ arp -an


in both VMs

$ screen

(press crtl + A , hold the crtl, then press D to swtich back)
(exit to close the screen session)

For xen-credit:

$ cd /root/liblitmus/mytools
$ nano /root/liblitmus/mytools/myapp.c change loopcount to 450
$ make

For xen-rtds:

$ cd /root/liblitmus/mytools
$ nano /root/liblitmus/mytools/myapp.c change loopcount to 480
$ make



$ cd /root/hypervisor_experiments

$ git pull



1. make sure you can ssh without password between Dom0 and VM1 ( it should be) (http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html)
2. change the ip addr in overhead_tracing/hyper_ovm.sh to VM1's ip
3. ssh into VM2 and change the duration (secs) in sched_experiments/rerun.sh to a larger number
4. from Dom0, $ bash hyper_ovm.sh
